This has been a long time coming. The number of times that I have started and restarted my blog are.. many. Usually I fail to get it off the ground due to the complexities involved in my attempts. Every attempt I make is disrupted before I even have a living code deployment. I have been over-ambitious, and under-wealthy in the currency of time. However, now that I know that the world still has a few years to go before the apocalypse, I have found the time and the simple-enough approach to get it done.

The blog you are reading now is the chronicle of my time as a journeyman in the crafts of software application development and game design. I am very interested in how these topics apply to the connected world of the internet, and most things that you find here will be related to that in some way.
